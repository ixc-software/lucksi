<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<b>Getsockopt</b>

and
<b>setsockopt</b>

manipulate the <i>options</i> associated with a socket. 
Options may exist at multiple protocol levels; they are always present at the
uppermost <b>socket</b> level.

When manipulating socket options the level at which the
option resides and the name of the option must be specified.
To manipulate options at the socket level,
<i>level</i>

is specified as <b>SOL_SOCKET</b>. To manipulate options at any


The parameters
<i>optval</i>

and
<i>optlen</i>

are used to access option values for
<b>setsockopt</b>.

For
<b>getsockopt</b>

they identify a buffer in which the value for the
requested option(s) are to be returned.  For
<b>getsockopt</b>,

<i>optlen</i>

is a value-result parameter, initially containing the
size of the buffer pointed to by
<i>optval</i>,

and modified on return to indicate the actual size of
the value returned.  If no option value is
to be supplied or returned,
<i>optval</i>

may be NULL.

<i>Optname</i>

and any specified options are passed uninterpreted to the appropriate
protocol module for interpretation.  The include file
<i>&lt;<a href="lwip/sockets.h">lwip/sockets.h</a>&gt;</i>

contains definitions for socket level options, described below.  Options at
other protocol levels vary in format and name; consult the appropriate
entries in section 4 of the manual.

Most socket-level options utilize an
<i>int</i>

parameter for
<i>optval</i>.

For
<b>setsockopt</b>,

the parameter should be non-zero to enable a boolean option, or zero if the
option is to be disabled.
<b>SO_LINGER</b> uses a <i>struct linger</i> parameter, defined in <i>&lt;
<a href="lwip/sockets.h">lwip/sockets.h</a>&gt;</i>,
which specifies the desired state of the option and the
linger interval (see below).
<b>SO_SNDTIMEO</b> and <b>SO_RCVTIMEO</b> use a <i>struct timeval</i>
parameter, defined in
<i>&lt;<a href="lwip/sockets.h">lwip/sockets.h</a>&gt;</i>.

The following options are recognized at the socket level.
Except as noted, each may be examined with
<b>getsockopt</b> and set with <b>setsockopt</b>. 

<dl COMPACT>
<dt>SO_REUSEADDR<dd>
enables local address reuse
<dt>SO_KEEPALIVE<dd>
enables keep connections alive
<dt>SO_LINGER<dd>
linger on close if data present
<dt>SO_BROADCAST<dd>
enables permission to transmit broadcast messages
<dt>SO_SNDTIMEO<dd>
get timeout value for output (get only)
<dt>SO_RCVTIMEO<dd>
get timeout value for input (get only)
<dt>SO_TYPE<dd>
get the type of the socket (get only)
<dt>SO_ERROR<dd>
get and clear error on the socket (get only)</dd>
        
</dl>

      
<b>SO_REUSEADDR</b>

indicates that the rules used in validating addresses supplied
in a
<b><a href="bind.html">bind</a></b> call should allow reuse of local addresses.
<b>SO_KEEPALIVE</b>
        
         
enables the periodic transmission of messages on a connected socket.&nbsp;

<b>SO_LINGER</b>
controls the action taken when unsent messages
are queued on socket and a <b><a href="close.html">close</a></b>
is performed.  If the socket promises reliable delivery of data and

<b>SO_LINGER</b> is set, the system will block the process on the 
<b>close</b> attempt until it is able to transmit the data or until it 
decides it is unable to deliver the information (a timeout period, termed the 
linger interval, is specified in the <b>setsockopt</b> call when <b>SO_LINGER</b> is requested).  If <b>SO_LINGER</b> is disabled and a <b>close</b> is issued,
the system will process the close in a manner that allows
the process to continue as quickly as possible.

The <i>linger</i> structure is defined in
<i>&lt;<a href="lwip/sockets.h">lwip/sockets.h</a>&gt;</i>
as follows:
<p>
<dl COMPACT><dt><dd>
<pre>
struct linger {
		int  l_onoff;   /* linger option on or off */
        int  l_linger;  /* How long to linger for */
};


<b>l_onoff</b>
indicates wether to linger or not. If it is set to 1 then
<b>l_linger</b>
contains the time in hundredths of seconds how long the process should
linger to complete the
<b>close</b>.
If
<b>l_onoff</b>
is set to zero the process returns immediately.

The option
<b>SO_BROADCAST</b>
requests permission to send broadcast datagrams on the socket.  Broadcast
was a privileged operation in earlier versions of the system.  With
protocols that support out-of-band data, the
<b>SO_OOBINLINE</b>
option requests that out-of-band data be placed in the normal data input
queue as received; it will then be accessible with
<b>recv</b>
or
<b>read</b>
calls without the
<b>MSG_OOB</b>
flag.  Some protocols always behave as if this option is set.
<b>SO_SNDBUF</b>
and
<b>SO_RCVBUF</b>
are options to adjust the normal buffer sizes allocated for output and
input buffers, respectively.  The buffer size may be increased for
high-volume connections, or may be decreased to limit the possible backlog
of incoming data.  The system places an absolute limit on these values.

<b>SO_SNDLOWAT</b>
is an option to set the minimum count for output operations.  Most output
operations process all of the data supplied by the call, delivering data to
the protocol for transmission and blocking as necessary for flow control.
Nonblocking output operations will process as much data as permitted
subject to flow control without blocking, but will process no data if flow
control does not allow the smaller of the low water mark value or the
entire request to be processed.  A
<b><a href="select.html">select</a></b>
operation testing the ability to write to a socket will return true only if
the low water mark amount could be processed.  The default value for
<b>SO_SNDLOWAT</b>
is set to a convenient size for network efficiency, often 1024.

<b>SO_RCVLOWAT</b>
is an option to set the minimum count for input operations.  In general,
receive calls will block until any (non-zero) amount of data is received,
then return with smaller of the amount available or the amount requested.
The default value for
<b>SO_RCVLOWAT</b>
is 1.
If 
<b>SO_RCVLOWAT</b>
is set to a larger value, blocking receive calls normally wait until they
have received the smaller of the low water mark value or the requested
amount.  Receive calls may still return less than the low water mark if an
error occurs, a signal is caught, or the type of data next in the receive
queue is different than that returned.

<b>SO_SNDTIMEO</b>
is an option to get the timeout value for output operations.
(It can be used with
<i>getsockopt</i>
only).  It returns a
<i>struct timeval</i>
parameter with the number of seconds and microseconds used to limit waits
for output operations to complete.  If a send operation has blocked for
this much time, it returns with a partial count or with the error
<b>EWOULDBLOCK</b>
if no data were sent.  In the current implementation, this timer is
restarted each time additional data are delivered to the protocol, implying
that the limit applies to output portions ranging in size from the low
water mark to the high water mark for output.
<b>SO_RCVTIMEO</b>
is an option to get the timeout value for input operations.
(It can be used with
<i>getsockopt</i>
only).  It returns a
<i>struct timeval</i>
parameter with the number of seconds and microseconds used to limit waits
for input operations to complete.  In the current implementation, this
timer is restarted each time additional data are received by the protocol,
and thus the limit is in effect an inactivity timer.  If a receive
operation has been blocked for this much time without receiving additional
data, it returns with a short count or with the error
<b>EWOULDBLOCK</b>
if no data were received.

Finally, also
<b>SO_TYPE</b>
and
<b>SO_ERROR</b>
are options used only with
<i>getsockopt</i>.
<b>SO_TYPE</b>
returns the type of the socket, such as
<b>SOCK_STREAM</b>;
it is useful for servers that inherit sockets on startup.
<b>SO_ERROR</b>
returns any pending error on the socket and clears the error status.  It
may be used to check for asynchronous errors on connected datagram sockets
or for other asynchronous errors.</pre></dd>

<h2>RETURN VALUE</h2>

On success, zero is returned. On error, -1 is returned, and the specific error
number can be obtained by calling the function GetSocketError. In a
multi-threaded environment the last error number is held separately for each 
thread.

The option is unknown at the level indicated.
<dt><b>EFAULT</b>

<dd>
The address pointed to by 
<i>optval</i>
