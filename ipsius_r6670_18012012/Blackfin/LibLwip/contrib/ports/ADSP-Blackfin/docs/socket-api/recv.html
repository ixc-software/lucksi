<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The <B>recvfrom</B> and <B>recvmsg</B> are used to receive messages from a 
socket, and may be used to receive data on a socket whether or not it is 
connection-oriented.If <I>from</I> is non-nil, and the socket is not 
connection-oriented, the source address of the message is filled in.
<I>Fromlen</I> is a value-result parameter, initialized to the size of the 
buffer associated with <I>from</I>, and modified on return to indicate the 
actual size of the address stored there.  The <B>recv</B> call is normally 
used only on a <I>connected</I> socket (see <B><A HREF="connect.html">connect</A></B>)
and is identical to <B>recvfrom</B> with a nil <I>from</I> parameter.  

All two routines return the length of the message on successful
completion.  If a message is too long to fit in the supplied buffer, excess
bytes may be discarded depending on the type of socket the message is
received from (see <B><A HREF="socket.html">socket</A></B>).


If no messages are available at the socket, the receive call waits for a
message to arrive, unless the socket is nonblocking,
in which case the value -1 is returned and the last socket error was  
set to <B>EWOULDBLOCK</B>.

The receive calls normally return any data available, up to the requested
amount, rather than waiting for receipt of the full amount requested; this
behavior is affected by the socket-level options
<B>SO_RCVLOWAT</B> and <B>SO_RCVTIMEO</B> described in
<B><A HREF="getsockopt.html">getsockopt</A></B>.


The <I>flags</I> argument to a recv call is formed by <I>or</I>'ing one or more of the values:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DT>MSG_OOB<DD>
<DD> process out-of-band data

<DT>MSG_PEEK
<DD> peek at incoming message

<DT>MSG_WAITALL
<DD>wait for full request or error

The <B>MSG_OOB</B> flag requests receipt of out-of-band data that would not be 
received in the normal data stream.  Some protocols place expedited data at 
the head of the normal data queue, and thus this flag cannot be used with such
protocols.

The <B>MSG_PEEK</B> flag causes the receive operation to return data from the
beginning of the receive queue without removing that data from the queue. 
Thus, a subsequent receive call will return the same data.  

The <B>MSG_WAITALL</B> flag requests that the operation block until the full 
request is satisfied.  However, the call may still return less data than 
requested if a signal is caught, an error or disconnect occurs, or the next 
data to be received is of a different type than that returned.

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUES</H2>

These calls return the number of bytes received, or -1
if an error occurred.

<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The argument <I>s</I> is an invalid. 

<DT><B>ENOTCONN</B>
<DD> The socket is associated with a connection-oriented protocol
and has not been connected (see <B><A HREF="connect.html">connect</A></B>

and
<B><A HREF="accept.html">accept</A></B>).


<DT><B>ENOTSOCK</B>
<DD> The argument <I>s</I> does not refer to a socket.<font color="red"> Not Supported </font>


<DT><B>EWOULDBLOCK</B>
<DD> The socket is marked non-blocking, and the receive operation would block, 
or a receive timeout had been set, and the timeout expired before data were 
received.

<DT><B>EINTR</B>
<DD> The receive was interrupted by delivery of a signal before
any data were available.<font color="red"> Not Supported </font>


<DT><B>EFAULT</B>
<DD> The receive buffer pointer(s) point outside the process's address space.<font color="red"> Not Supported </font>
